# Heroku Deployment Exercise on [Heart Disease UCI Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)

## Information about the codes

- Built a logistic regression model with an accuracy of approximately 80-85% stored in the `model` file
- Modified the codes on `app.py` in order to deploy my logistic regression model, and updated `requirements.txt` to the most recent version of the packages
- Was not successful modifying the codes in the `templates` file creating the UI of the webpage to fit my `app.py`
   - Hence I was not able to deploy the entire file to Heroku to build an webstie
